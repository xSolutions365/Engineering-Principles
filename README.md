# Engineering Principles

This is a practical guide to what good engineering looks like at CreateFuture.  
It sets out a shared understanding of quality across all teams, projects, and levels of experience — something we can all refer to, build on, and hold each other to.

These principles balance **craft with pragmatism**. We optimise for real outcomes for **users and clients**, not abstract “best practice”. The “right” answer is the one that fits the context, delivers value quickly, and can evolve safely as needs change.

### How to use this guide
- Start from the **category** that matches your decision (architecture, code, reliability, or context).
- Pick the **principle** that best frames your trade‑off.
- Use the **practices as examples**, not a checklist — right‑size for the client’s maturity, risk, and constraints.
- Make trade‑offs explicit (what we’re doing now, what we’ll revisit later, and how we’ll measure impact).

> **What this is / isn’t**  
> • Guidance, not policy.  
> • Examples, not mandates.  
> • Plain language; minimal jargon.  
> • User and client outcomes come first.
